### Project: PayMeLah

PayMeLah is a desktop app for **keeping track of** and **managing the debts** your friends owe you. It can also help **do simple calculations** for you, such as including GST or splitting debts amongst your friends. Whatâ€™s more, it is optimised for you to do everything from just your keyboard!
